# Using-PubMed-MEDLINE-Metadata-to-Generate-Knowledge
## MVP Descriptor
This tool allows the user to cross-examine two concepts of interest across PubMed citations using a MeSH terms of interest.  For example, suppose I wanted to know "the where" of publications about about Zika virus.  In such a query, I may choose to enter one of more the relevant MeSH terms (the MVP will support multiple MeSH terms), "Zika Virus" and "Zika Virus Infection", to build my PubMed corpus of interest.  Since I am interested in geographic information about these publications, I may wish to enter "Geographic Locations" as my second input parameter.  The tool would analyze the data by quantifying the citations across the first child nodes of "Geographic Locations", which can be explored using the [Mesh Browser]('https://meshb.nlm.nih.gov/search') (for this particular term, the children can be seen [here]('https://meshb.nlm.nih.gov/record/ui?ui=D005842')
