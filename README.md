# Using-PubMed-MEDLINE-Metadata-to-Generate-Knowledge

# Initial Goal

The goal of the project is to enable easy access to the information in
PubMed/MEDLINE by developing a tool that uses the indexed MeSH terms
in selected citations to produce a data visualization. For a specific
disease, e.g. ulcerative colitis, tool would use the MeSH terms that
are drugs used to treat ulcerative colitis and create a bar chart or
heat map to show the most commonly indexed drugs. Ideally, the tool
would allow a user to select a disease term and retrieve drugs used to
treat the disease. Eventually, the tool could be expanded to cover
other aspects of the disease such as epidemiology, pathology and
more.
